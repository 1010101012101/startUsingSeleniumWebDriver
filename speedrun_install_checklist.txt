Generic Selenium WebDriver Windows Install Speedrun checklist
=============================================================

[ ] Check what you need to install by typing console commands
    [ ] "javac -version"
          - if it fails install java jdk
    [ ] "mvn -version"
          - if it fails install maven

[ ] Install Current version of Firefox

[ ] Download Java
     [ ] search for "download java sdk" (do not install the normal JRE from java.com)

[ ] Install Java JDK
     - e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_10
     [ ] add the Java "\bin" folder to the path if it hasn't been added 
	     e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_10\bin
     [ ] create a JAVA_HOME environment variable while there for the root path 
	     e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_10
         - some people add a JDK_HOME for the root path as well (I haven't done this)

[ ] Install Maven
     [ ] Download Maven http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation
     [ ] Unzip maven to a directory (avoid one with spaces in it)
          - e.g. C:\mvn\apache-maven-3.0.4
     [ ] create maven environment variables
[ ] create an M2_HOME in System Variables
     - C:\mvn\apache-maven-3.0.4
[ ] add %M2_HOME%\bin to the path in System Variables

[ ] everything is installed, check the environment variables by displaying them on the console
     [ ] echo %M2_HOME%
     [ ] echo %JAVA_HOME%

[ ] Download Test Project (this has a simple pom.xml and a basic test to run)
     [ ] visit https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingSeleniumWebDriver
     [ ] download the zip file and unzip somewhere

[ ] check most up to date version of webdriver in the unzipped pom.xml file
     [ ] check the webdriver downloads page or the maven page for the up to date version
     [ ] amend the pom.xml file if the version number is not up to date

[ ] run my first test from the command line
     [ ] use the command line to "cd" to the directory you unarchived the source code to
     [ ] mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstTest

[ ] Install and run IntelliJ Community Edition

[ ] open project for the unzipped pom.xml file

[ ] run MyFirstTest class
     [ ] right click on the class in the project window and select "Run 
     [ ] you may need to tell intellij where the SDK is, 
	     - use the project settings to create an new SDK config
           using the JAVA_HOME path above

[ ] When the test runs from the IDE, you are finished your install and setup

Generic Links:
==============

+ Download Java SDK From
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
  - 1.8 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
  - 1.7 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

+ Download Maven From
http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

+ sample test project from
https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingSeleniumWebDriver

+ Check current webdriver version from
http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/
or
http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/maven.jsp

+ Download IntelliJ from
http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

Installation on XP Notes:
=========================

- I installed using the Windows XP VM from modern.ie, 
  with Java 1.7, maven 3.2.3, Webdriver 2.43.1, IntelliJ 13.1.5

- need to use JDK 1.7, JDK 1.8 reports a warning on Windows XP

- download a different text editor to edit the pom.xml (I used notepad++)
     - You may need to download a better editor than notepad.exe I use notepad++
     -  download notepad ++ from 
     http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download

- You need to 'unblock' Java and the IDE etc. 
  for the Windows Firewall as you run through the checklist. 
  Do this, otherwise they won't be able to work

- Edit SDK by right clicking and choosing "Open Module Settings", 
  then edit the SDK for the Project and press [OK]
  - choose the location of the Java JDK you installed 
    (sometimes you don't have to do this)

+ After test passes in the IDE - ignore the Info Message from WebDriver

"Oct 07, 2014 10:40:36 AM org.openqa.selenium.os.UnixProcess$SeleniumWatchDog destroyHarder
INFO: Command failed to close cleanly. Destroying forcefully (v2). 
org.openqa.selenium.os.UnixProcess$SeleniumWatchDog@da44a7

Process finished with exit code 0
"
It worked fine
